# LoRaPlan

LoRaPlan is a software to study and evaluate the placement of LoRaWAN gateways.

To run the software, execute the *gatewayplanning_main.py* file in the *software* directory, using python 3.9 or higher. The required libraries are:

* pandas
* tkinter
* numpy
* matplotlib

Running the software using Windows or Linux is recommended, as the software has performance issues on macOS.

The software has only been tested for compatability with python 3.9. Other versions of python may present compatability issues.
